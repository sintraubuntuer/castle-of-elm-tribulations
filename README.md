# Castle Of Elm Tribulations 

Castle of Elm Tribulations is a minimalistic Rogue like game , inspired by Castle of Elm ( Claudia Doppioslash - https://github.com/doppioslash/CastleOfElm ) , Atic Atac , Roguelike in Elm by deadfoxygrandpa https://github.com/deadfoxygrandpa/Roguelike , Sleeping Beauty's Game of Thorns https://ondras.github.io/sleeping-beauty/ , ... 

The game is already functional , and i strongly advise you to try it :-)  , but it can still be improved in some ways ... like for instance adding sound ( if you want to collaborate please let me know )

The project ( on my part ) started as a  conversion of the C# RogueSharp library to Elm  
and that's what most of  MapGen module is all about ( although some algorithms  are still  missing ) ...

... and this year i suddenly decided to also use it to make a nice little game and participate in the 64 game jam : 


There's still a lot of code cleanup to do but i decided to share it anyway
