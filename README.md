# Castle Of Elm Tribulations 

Castle of Elm Tribulations is a minimalistic Rogue like game , inspired by Castle of Elm ( Claudia Doppioslash - https://github.com/doppioslash/CastleOfElm ) , Atic Atac , Roguelike in Elm by deadfoxygrandpa , Sleeping Beauty's Game of Thorns , ... 

The game is already functional , and i strongly advise you to try it :-)  , but it can still be improved in some ways ... like for instance adding sound ( if you wantto collaborate please let me know )

The project was originally a conversion of C# RogueSharp library to Elm  
and thats what most of  MapGen module is all about ( althought there are still some algorithms missing )
but i also decided to use it to make a nice little game for this years game jam : 

There's still a lot of code cleanup to do but i decided to share it anyway 



Game Hints :
Find your way through the Caverns, Basement , The Ground Floor , First Floor and the Attic , pick up the three pieces of paper with the codes to unlock the black door and move towards enlightenment !!!
